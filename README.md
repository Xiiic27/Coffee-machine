# Coffee-machine
A learning Python learning project designed by Jetbrains Academy

This is a program, which simulates how coffee machine works in real life. 
It should repeatedly ask a user what they want to do. 
If the user types "buy", "fill" or "take", then the program should do exactly the same thing it did in the previous step. 
However, if the user wants to switch off the coffee machine, they should type "exit". The program should terminate on this command. 
Also, when the user types "remaining", the program should output all the resources that the coffee machine has.
